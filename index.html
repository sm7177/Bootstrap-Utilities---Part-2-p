                    Heartbroken, Julie skips his funeral, throws out his things, and tries everything to forget him and
                    the tragic way he died. But a message Sam left behind in her yearbook forces back memories.
                    Desperate to hear his voice one more time, Julie calls Sam’s cellphone just to listen to his
                    voicemail.

                    Priory of the Orange Tree and into the lives of four women, showing us a course of events that
                    shaped their world for generations to come.
                    <br>
                    Tunuva Melim is a sister of the Priory. For fifty years, she has trained to slay wyrms but none have
                    appeared since the Nameless One, and the younger generation is starting to question the Priory's
                    purpose.
                    To the north, Sabran the Ambitious has married the new King of Hróth.

                    The House of Berethnet has ruled Inys for a thousand years. Still unwed, Queen Sabran the Ninth must
                    conceive a daughter to protect her realm from destruction – but assassins are getting closer to her
                    door.

                    Ead Duryan is an outsider at court. Though she has risen to the position of lady-in-waiting, she is
                    loyal to a hidden society of mages. Ead keeps a watchful eye on Sabran, secretly protecting her with
                    forbidden magic.

                    being hidden from the feared Celestial Emperor who exiled her mother for stealing his elixir of
                    immortality. But when Xingyin’s magic flares and her existence is discovered, she is forced to flee
                    her home, leaving her mother behind.
                    <br>
                    Alone, powerless, and afraid, she makes her way to the Celestial Kingdom, a land of wonder and
                    secrets. Disguising her identity, she seizes an opportunity to learn alongside the emperor's son,
                    mastering archery and magic.
